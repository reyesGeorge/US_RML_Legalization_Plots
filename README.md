# US_RML_Legalization_Plots
Map visualizations of the legalization of medical and recreational cannabis in the US from 2012-2020. The medical cannabis designation "M" also includes CBD, which is hemp derived and may not contain high levels of THC, but the "RML" designation is for high THC concetrate cannabis only.

All data was gathered by hand for an econometrics project.
